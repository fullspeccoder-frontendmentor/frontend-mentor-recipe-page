## Overview

This project is a static webpage that presents a straightforward recipe for a delicious simple omelette. The focus is on creating a clean and responsive design suitable for both mobile and desktop devices.
Some of the key features of this webpage include: semantic html5 structure, css styling, responsive design, & a reset css.
I used media queries, css, & html5 to provide a structured, styled, & responsive design in this project.
I addressed challenges related to responsive design principles to ensure a cohesive user experience on various devices and ensured cross-browser compatibility through the reset CSS file.
I have made this webpage in a way to create an option for future enhancements for individual features.
